## Examples of Design Patterns
- **Factory pattern.** Define an interface (abstract class) for creating object, but let the subclasses decide which class to initiate
- **Abstract pattern.** Define an interface (abstract class) for creating families objects without specifying their concrete sub classes
- **Singleton pattern.** Define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access
- **Builder pattern.** Construct a complex object from simple objects, using step-by-step approach.
- **Prototype pattern.** Creating clone of an existing object instead of creating new one and can be customized
- **Adapter pattern.** Converts the interface of a class into another interface that a client wants.
- **Bridge pattern.** Decouple abstraction from its implementation, so that we can vary independently.
- **Composite pattern.** Composes objects in trm of a tree structure to represent part as well as whole hierarchy
- **Decorator pattern.** Attach a flexible additional responcsibilities to an object dynamically
- **Facade pattern.** Describe a higher-level interface that makes the sub-system easier to use
- **Flyweight pattern.**  Reuse already existing similar kind of objects by storing them and create new object when no matching object is found
- **Proxy pattern.** Provides the control for accessing the original object.
- **ChainOfResponsibility pattern.** Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request
- **Command pattern.** Encapsulate a request under an object.
- **Interpreter pattern.** Define a representation of grammar of a given language
- **Iterator pattern.** Get a way to access the elements of a collection object in sequential manner without any need to know its underlying representation
- **Mediator pattern.** Reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes.
- **Memento pattern.** Save and restore the state of an object without violating encapsulation.
- **Observer pattern.** Define a one-to-one dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
- **State pattern.** The class behavior changes based on its state.
- **Strategy pattern.** Defines a family of functionality, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
- **Template method.** Define the skeleton of a function in an operation.
- **Visitor pattern.** Use a visitor class which changes the executing algorithm of an element class.
